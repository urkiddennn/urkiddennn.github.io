                            Greetings, Diokie. I wanted to start by stating how
                            appreciative I am to have you, even though I tell
                            you this all the time. I recall seeing you for the
                            first time on November 21, 2023. At the time, you
                            were wearing glasses. I noticed you wereÂ laying on
                            the table that same day. You're always the first
                            person I find when the event continues till day
                            three, "asa kaha to sya". upon reaching Tandog after
                            a four-hours journey. I wanted to thank you for the
                            service and for allowing me to take picture with
                            you. We spoke for a while, and it wasn't until
                            recently that I realized how important you have
                            become to me.
                        </p>
